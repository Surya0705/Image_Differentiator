# Image_Differentiator
This is a Python Program that Displays the Differences between two Images. It uses a Module named Pillow which in most of the cases I think is Pre-Installed. If it isn't then just use the following command (If you are on Windows) in your Terminal/Powershell/CMD:
```
pip install pillow
```
Or if you are on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS which I have used) then just type the following in your Bash:
```
pip3 install pillow
```
Or Install it according to your OS. After installation run the [Main.py](Main.py) file and it will give the differences between the two images whose path you gave in line 3 and 4. You could also Improvise by instead giving on Image Paths, use the tkinter filedialog. Below is the Screenshot of My Program:

As you can see here the Window shows the point of differences between two Images. I have also Uploaded those two Images incase if you want to use it. Hope that you liked it.
